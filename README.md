<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved developing a Power BI dashboard to analyze urgent air freight trends and provide insights into the primary reasons for last-minute shipments. The dashboard visualizes freight costs across air, road, and sea, with a focus on identifying patterns in urgent air shipments. It enables logistics teams to assess recurring causes for urgency, supporting better planning and the strategic use of cost-effective alternatives like sea and road freight. The reporting tool provides actionable insights to optimize freight management and reduce unnecessary air transport expenses.
